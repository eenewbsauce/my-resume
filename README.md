## Professional History

**SENIOR APPLICATION DEVELOPER - MARKETING**

**Red Hat (IBM), Remote**

With millions of individual marketing engagements captured online, at in-person events, and through partners, there was a need to aggregate and surface this data by customer account. The resulting dashboard greatly improved marketers ability to target existing and potential accounts.

- Currently working as a full stack engineer on an account-based marketing platform deployed on Open Shift
- The UI is built with an emphasis on component driven development and is heavily unit and end to end tested
- The app extensively uses MongoDB aggregations and queries, MySQL stored procedures, and RPC
- I have created repeatable processes for scaffolding API endpoints, middleware, components, pages, and unit tests
- I am responsible for many domains including UI architecture, API development, and DevOps

**JustSift (Quicken Loans), Detroit, MI**

- Built out a highly scalable SaaS-based directory application called Sift
- Sift consists of a mobile-ready Angular JS front-end which is served via CloudFront CDN (AWS)
- The API is OAuth2 authenticated, featuring a full-text search implemented in Elasticsearch, built on Node.js/Express and is multi-tenant ready at its core
- The Angular JS app is built using cutting edge tools like Browserify, Gulp and Babel
- The entire app (front and back end) is written modularly using ES6
- Modularity was achieved using NPM modules and sophisticated custom tools that I wrote to implement versioning across the 8 Github repos that compose Sift
- The Sift architecture is something that I am extremely proud of building and I’ve learned a lot from it
