## Professional History

**SENIOR APPLICATION DEVELOPER - MARKETING** (_05/2019 - Present_)

**Red Hat Canada (IBM), Remote**

**AccountIQ - Account-Based Marketing Platform**

- With millions of discrete marketing engagements being captured annually, there was a need to simplify the data and highlight trends within target accounts.
- On a weekly basis, thousands of accounts are summarized, using small engagement signals to surface highly actionable ones.
- With hundreds of monthly active users, the platform has greatly improved marketing and sales workflows and outcomes.

**MO-Hub - Marketing Campaign Management**

- Having hundreds of marketers across the globe, creating consistent, trackable marketing campaigns and events is a sizable problem.
- MO-Hub centralizes these workflows by ensuring proper data entry as well as integration with Salesforce CRM, Eloqua email automation, and accounting systems.
- A migration from a heavily customized legacy Salesforce instance to a streamlined modern instance, requires our team to implement a new solution for campaign storage and integration.
- The solution, code-named Nimbus, is currently in development. A suite of microservcies and new data stores will replace the aging CRM in Q2 2023.

**SOFTWARE ENGINEER - PERSONAL FINANCE** (_08/2016 - 04/2019_)

**RocketLoans (Rocket Mortgage), Detroit, MI**

- Lending is highly regulated industry and must be handled with utmost care. Ensuring customers meet all eligibility criteria before a loan is closed is a difficult problem to solve.
- A checklist mechanism, to synchronize the outstanding tasks between the customer and the operations team was created. I played a major role in delivering this project.
- Over time, this solution led to simplified workflows for the operations team and improved expectations for loan clients.

**SOFTWARE ENGINEER - HUMAN RESOURCES** (_10/2015 - 08/2016_)

**JustSift (Rocket Mortgage), Detroit, MI**

- Built out a highly scalable SaaS-based directory application called Sift
- Sift consists of a mobile-ready Angular JS front-end which is served via CloudFront CDN (AWS)
- The API is OAuth2 authenticated, featuring a full-text search implemented in Elasticsearch, built on Node.js/Express and is multi-tenant ready at its core
- The Angular JS app is built using cutting edge tools like Browserify, Gulp and Babel
- The entire app (front and back end) is written modularly using ES6
- Modularity was achieved using NPM modules and sophisticated custom tools that I wrote to implement versioning across the 8 Github repos that compose Sift
- The Sift architecture is something that I am extremely proud of building and I learned a lot from it
