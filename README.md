- The API is OAuth2 authenticated, featuring a full-text search implemented in Elasticsearch, built on Node.js/Express and is multi-tenant ready at its core
- The Angular JS app is built using cutting edge tools like Browserify, Gulp and Babel
- The entire app (front and back end) is written modularly using ES6
- Modularity was achieved using NPM modules and sophisticated custom tools that I wrote to implement versioning across the 8 Github repos that compose Sift
